# Feedforward Neural Network Visualization

This Python code uses the VPython library to create a 3D visualization of a feedforward neural network. The network consists of presynaptic neurons, a postsynaptic neuron, synapses, and labels.

## How to Run

You can run this code using an online Python platform like Trinket. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io/).
2. Click on "Create" to start a new project.
3. Choose "Python" as the language.
4. Copy and paste the entire code into the editor.
5. Click on the "Run" button to execute the code.

The 3D visualization of the neural network will be displayed in the Trinket window.

## About the Code

- `neuron_positions`: Defines the positions of the neurons in 3D space.
- `pre_neurons`: Creates presynaptic neurons as green spheres.
- `post_neuron`: Creates the postsynaptic neuron as a red sphere.
- Labels are added to each neuron for identification.

Synapses are represented as cylinders connecting presynaptic neurons to the postsynaptic neuron. Circles perpendicular to arrows are added for visualization.

## Scene Manipulation

The camera view can be adjusted by using the following controls:

- Zoom in/out: Scroll up/down
- Rotate view: Click and drag
